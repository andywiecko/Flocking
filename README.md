# Flocking

![example](Documentation~/example.png)

Challenge _mini_ project developed during "Self Dev Days" at Laparo.

Currently, this is a brute-force _flocking model_ implementation.
Possible upgrades are planned to do during the next "Self Dev Days".
The model is more or less based on these papers:[^1],[^2], and [^3].

Example **VIDEO**. TODO

Download build (for Windows) demo: **TODO**

Check web demo browser version: **TODO** üî¥WARNINGüî¥ _Currently Burst is not supported for WebGL builds, maximum boids count is reduced._)

## Dependencies

- [`Unity.Burst`](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.burst@1.6/manual/index.html)
- [`Unity.Jobs`](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/JobSystem.html)
- [`andywiecko.BurstMathUtils`](https://github.com/andywiecko/BurstMathUtils.git)

## TODO

Things to consider:

- [ ] Try ECS.
- [X] ~~Try WebGL build.~~
- [ ] Optimization: spatial hashing/quad tree.
- [ ] Obstacle avoidance.
- [ ] Express forces in PBD framework.
- [ ] Additional force with respect to the defined path.
- [ ] Add random force (should prevent from boids gluing?)
